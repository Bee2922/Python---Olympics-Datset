# Python-Olympics-Dataset
The dataset being analysed is the Olympics dataset from the years 1992 to 1998, which contains 7,000 entries and 15 columns. These columns include participant names, sport types, ages, genders, medals, countries represented, etc. The dataset was cleaned using Python, including the removal of duplicates. Although null values were identified, they were left unchanged, as removing them could negatively impact the analysis. Visualizations were created to provide insights, such as trends over time in the number of participants, the country with the highest number of medals, and the distribution of participants' heights, etc.
